// Your goal in this kata is to implement a difference function, which subtracts one list from another and returns the result.

// It should remove all values from list a, which are present in list b keeping their order.

// arrayDiff([1,2],[1]) == [2]

// If a value is present in b, all of its occurrences must be removed from the other:

// arrayDiff([1,2,2,2,3],[2]) == [1,3]

function arrayDiff(a, b) {
    if (a.legnth === 0) {
      return [];}
    if (b.length === 0) {
      return a;} 
    let newA = a
    let newB = b
a.forEach((arrItem, arrIndex) => {
    const aCopy = newA.slice();
    const bCopy = newB.slice();
    if (b.includes (arrItem)){
    newA = aCopy.filter(item => item !== arrItem);       
}
});
    return newA        
}
