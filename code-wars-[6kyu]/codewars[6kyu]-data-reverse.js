// A stream of data is received and needs to be reversed.

// Each segment is 8 bits long, meaning the order of these segments needs to be reversed, for example:

// 11111111  00000000  00001111  10101010
//  (byte1)   (byte2)   (byte3)   (byte4)

// should become:

// 10101010  00001111  00000000  11111111
//  (byte4)   (byte3)   (byte2)   (byte1)

// The total number of bits will always be a multiple of 8.

// The data is given in an array as such:

// [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0]

// Note: In the C and NASM languages you are given the third parameter which is the number of segment blocks.

function dataReverse(data) {
    let result = [];
    
    for (let i = data.length; i > 0; i -= 8) {
      result.push(...data.slice(i - 8, i));
    }
  
    return result;
  }
