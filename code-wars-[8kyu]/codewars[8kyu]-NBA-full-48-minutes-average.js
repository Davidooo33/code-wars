// An NBA game runs 48 minutes (Four 12 minute quarters). Players do not typically play the full game, subbing in and out as necessary. Your job is to extrapolate a player's points per game if they played the full 48 minutes.

// Write a function that takes two arguments, ppg (points per game) and mpg (minutes per game) and returns a straight extrapolation of ppg per 48 minutes rounded to the nearest tenth. Return 0 if 0.

// Examples:

// pointsPer48(12, 20) // 28.8
// pointsPer48(10, 10) // 48
// pointsPer48(5, 17) // 14.1
// pointsPer48(0, 0) // 0

function pointsPer48(ppg, mpg) {
  if (ppg === 0 || mpg === 0) return 0;
  return +(ppg * (48 / mpg)).toFixed(1);
}
